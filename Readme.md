1. Project Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to optimize marketing campaigns for customer acquisition. The model will improve campaign effectiveness by targeting potential customers more accurately and minimizing digital marketing costs.

2. Business Problem
The primary goal is to increase the effectiveness of marketing campaigns aimed at acquiring new customers for HSBC Holdings plc's banking products. Key business objectives include:

- Improving customer engagement with new services.
- Reducing digital marketing costs.
- Enhancing customer acquisition rates.

3. Data Description
The dataset consists of various customer and campaign attributes, including:

- Demographics: Age, job, marital status, etc.
- Financials: Balance, loan status.
- Campaign details: Previous contacts, campaign type, and duration.
- Target variable: y, indicating customer response (yes/no).
- See the file columns for specific lists of columns used in imputation and encoding processes.

4. Project Phases
Following the CRISP-DM methodology, the project was divided into the following stages:

- Data Understanding: Identified key features and potential relationships.
- Data Preparation: Included data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
- Modeling: Multiple models were tested, focusing on GradientBoostingClassifier.
- Evaluation and Optimization: Used metrics to evaluate model performance and optimize hyperparameters.
- Deployment: Structured code for deployment and created scripts for training and prediction.

5. Feature Engineering
Key preprocessing steps included:

- Imputation: Missing values were imputed using methods tailored to each column (e.g., median, mode, end of distribution).
- Encoding: Categorical variables were encoded using one-hot encoding, integer encoding, and frequency encoding as required.
- Outlier Detection: Outliers were managed using IQR for selected columns.
Refer to the columns file for detailed lists of imputation and encoding strategies used.

6. Modeling
The GradientBoostingClassifier was chosen after evaluating several models. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted using RandomizedSearchCV to improve model performance. Given class imbalance (89.35% class 0 and 10.65% class 1), we explored:

- Undersampling and oversampling techniques.
- Class weighting adjustments.
- Evaluation metrics suitable for imbalanced data, such as F1-score and ROC-AUC.

7. Evaluation Metrics
Metrics selected to measure the effectiveness of the model:

- Confusion Matrix: To understand misclassifications.
- F1-Score: To balance precision and recall in an imbalanced dataset.
- ROC-AUC Curve: To assess the classifierâ€™s ability to distinguish between classes.

8. Model Deployment
Deployment was structured in Visual Studio Code and involved:

- Code organization into modular scripts for training and prediction.
- Documentation of the project pipeline in this README.
- Reflection on each project phase and decisions made along the way.

9. Results and Reflection
After testing and optimization, the GradientBoostingClassifier demonstrated robust performance, achieving:

- A high ROC-AUC score indicating good discrimination between classes.
- A balanced F1-score appropriate for the imbalanced data.

Key learnings from this project:

- Importance of tailored imputation and encoding techniques.
- Effective management of class imbalance through various sampling techniques.
- Balancing business goals with model interpretability and performance.
